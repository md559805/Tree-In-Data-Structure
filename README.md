# Tree-In-Data-Structure
This C++ program constructs an expression tree from a user-inputted infix mathematical expression, supporting operators +, -, *, /, ^, and parentheses. It performs multiple tree traversals (level order, preorder, inorder, postorder, RNL, RLN) and displays the tree in a vertical graphical representation.
